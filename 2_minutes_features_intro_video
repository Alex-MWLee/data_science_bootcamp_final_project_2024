The 2 minutes intro video is hosted in my Google drive and is free to watch through the following link:

Because the datacamp school limited always the presenation time to 5 minutes totally. Actually personally I think, it is good to limit the time in order to extract important points, but strict limitation of only 5 minutes is meaningless and is not a good way to practise the presentation skills rather than arising only the pressure). 

But it happened already, and I followed already the rule. It means for me that I will only have only 2 minutes to introduce the features. 

Due to this initialization, I created this video with my pure intention to showcase them fully and focusedly as this very short time.
