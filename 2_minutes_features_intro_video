Due to the Datacamp school limiting the presentation time to 5 minutes, I had only 2 minutes to introduce the features. While I agree that time constraints help in extracting important points, I believe that a strict 5-minute limitation adds unnecessary pressure and may not provide enough practice for developing strong presentation skills.

Nevertheless, I adhered to the rule and created this video with the pure intention of showcasing the key features effectively within this very short timeframe.
